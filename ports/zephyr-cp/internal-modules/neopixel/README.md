# neopixel

A Zephyr module that transmits NeoPixel (WS2812-style) LED data on a pin
chosen at runtime. Callers hand it pixel bytes in the strip's byte order and
a package pin they own; the SoC implementation picks the transmit hardware
per call. On nRF that is a PWM instance's DMA sequence playback, allocated
from the [iobroker](../iobroker/README.md) module for the duration of the
transfer, with a bit-bang fallback when every instance is busy.

## Status

Implemented for nRF SoCs. On other SoCs the module compiles but
`neopixel_send()` returns `-ENOSYS`.

## Source layout

```
include/neopixel/neopixel.h    # public API
src/
  neopixel.c                   # -ENOSYS stubs when no SoC implementation
  nordic/
    nrf/
      neopixel_nrf.c           # PWM sequence playback + bit-bang fallback
```

Each vendor adds a `src/<vendor>/<soc>/` directory with an implementation of
`neopixel_send()`, its `NEOPIXEL_PATTERN_BUFFER_SIZE()` formula in the public
header, a corresponding `zephyr_library_sources_ifdef()` line in
`CMakeLists.txt`, and its SoC condition in the `#if` that guards the stub in
`src/neopixel.c`.

## Enabling

The module is registered by the CircuitPython Zephyr application
(`ports/zephyr-cp/CMakeLists.txt`) via `ZEPHYR_EXTRA_MODULES`, so it works
without west manifest changes. It depends on the iobroker module for
peripheral allocation and package pin resolution.

## Public API

See `include/neopixel/neopixel.h`. `NEOPIXEL_PATTERN_BUFFER_SIZE()` tells the
caller how large a pattern buffer (the waveform built from the pixel bytes) a
transfer of a given length needs, as a constant expression, so the caller
decides where that memory lives; `neopixel_send()` transmits. The caller
configures the pin as an output driving low before the call and paces
successive calls so that the strip's reset (latch) period elapses between
them.
