// The format of the compressed data is:
// - the size of the uncompressed string in UTF-8 bytes, encoded as a
//   (compress_max_length_bits)-bit number.  compress_max_length_bits is
//   computed during dictionary generation time, and happens to be 8
//   for all current platforms.  However, it'll probably end up being
//   9 in some translations sometime in the future.  This length excludes
//   the trailing NUL, though notably decompress_length includes it.
//
// - followed by the huffman encoding of the individual UTF-16 code
//   points that make up the string.  The trailing "\0" is not
//   represented by a huffman code, but is implied by the length.
//   (building the huffman encoding on UTF-16 code points gave better
//   compression than building it on UTF-8 bytes)
//
// The "data" / "tail" construct is so that the struct's last member is a
// "flexible array".  However, the _only_ member is not permitted to be
// a flexible member, so we have to declare the first byte as a separte
// member of the structure.
//
// For translations where length needs 8 bits, this saves about 1.5
// bytes per string on average compared to a structure of {uint16_t,
// flexible array}, but is also future-proofed against strings with
// UTF-8 length above 256, with a savings of about 1.375 bytes per
// string.
